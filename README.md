# ePassportTerminal

Source code for the course "Programming for Security" at Roskilde University.

The program implemented 3DES encryption/decryption for transferring encrypted information from an electronic passport to a Java-based program. It was developed based on the specification specified by ICAO (https://www.icao.int/publications/documents/9303_p11_cons_en.pdf)

It can generate session key, generate APDU command, process APDU response, fetch EF.COM, DG1 and DG2 (passport holder's photo).

Code for the Arduino program to physically connect to an e-passport is not provided.
